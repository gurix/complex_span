  INSTRUCTION_1:
    THANK_YOU: '<p>Thank you very much for taking part in our experiment! The experiment will take about 10 to 15 minutes.</p>'
    TEXT: '<p>In each trial you will see 10 words presented sequentially. All words refer to concrete objects. You have two tasks:</p>
           <p>Your first task is to judge for each word whether the object it refers to is larger or smaller than a soccer ball.</p>
           <p>If the object is <strong>smaller</strong> than a soccer ball, please press the <strong>left</strong> arrow key;</p>
           <p>if the object is <strong>larger</strong> than a soccer ball, please press the <strong>right</strong> arrow key.</p>
           <p>Your second task is to remember all the  <strong>red words</strong> in their <strong>order of presentation</strong>. You don’t need to remember the blue words.<br>
           At the end of the presentation of all 10 words you will be asked to select the red words from a set of 15 words. Please click on
           the 5 red words that you remembered in their order of presentation.<br>
           If you do not remember all words nevertheless try to select each word at the position it initially appeared. For example, if you do not remember the third red word that was presented, but the fourth red word, please select the fourth word as the fourth word.</p>
           <p>You will first do two practice trials, followed by 12 test trials.</p>'

    DEBRIEFING: '<p>Thank you again for participating in our experiment. The goal of this experiment was to investigate whether people can intentionally forget
                    information they want to forget, and whether this is accomplished better when more time is available for forgetting. To that end we tested,
                    in the last trial, your memory for the blue words, which you were supposed to forget. We varied the free time following
                    each of the blue words – either only 200 ms or 1500 ms after each blue word. We expect that participants who
                    had longer free time following the blue words are able to remember fewer of them. </p>
                    <p>Please do not share this information with anyone! It is crucial the explanation is kept confidential until we have collected all data.</p>
                 <p>Here is your code to confirm your participation: Cspan-DRM-1</p>
