p Thank you very much for taking part in our experiment! The experiment will take about 15 minutes.

p In each trial you will see 10 words presented sequentially. All words refer to concrete objects. You have two tasks:

p Your first task is to judge for each word whether the object it refers to is larger or smaller than a soccer ball.

p If the object is <strong>smaller</strong> than a soccer ball, please press the <strong>left</strong> arrow key;

p if the object is <strong>larger</strong> than a soccer ball, please press the <strong>right</strong> arrow key.

p Your second task is to remember all the red words in their order of presentation. You donâ€™t need to remember the blue words. At the end of the presentation of all 10 words you will be asked to select the red words from a set of 15 words. Please click on the 5 red words that you remembered in their order of presentation.

p You will first do two practice trials, followed by 12 test trials.
